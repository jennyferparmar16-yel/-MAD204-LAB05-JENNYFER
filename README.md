An Android application built with Kotlin that allows users to select images or videos, save them as favorites using a Room database, display them in a RecyclerView, and export/import favorites using GSON. The app uses SharedPreferences to restore the last opened media and supports edge-to-edge UI with delete and undo functionality.
